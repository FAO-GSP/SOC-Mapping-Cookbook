# Deliverables {#deliverables}
*Y. Yigini*

In 2016, the the need of the development of a tool to assess global soil organic carbon stocks was identified by the GSP Plenary Assembly. As a contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal indicator 15.3.1 which aims at estimating the total degraded land area, the prepartory work to deliver GSOCmap from a country driven bottom-up approach, was completed by the end of 2016.

During 2017, the GSOCmap V1.0 was realized. The soil data shared by contributing countries was collected by the GSP Secretariat. The [*GSP Soil Data Policy*](http://www.fao.org/3/a-bs975e.pdf) [see @gsp_data_2017, Chapter 8.5], ensured that the national terms of condition are fully respected. National soil data was compiled and harmonized with regard to differences in laboratory methodologies and sampling units, and a global soil database was created using recovered soil data legacy from archives, SIS institutions and projects. Finally, a global data harmonization was conducted by the GSP Secretariat including quality control, mosaicking, border harmoization and gap filling.

The GSOCmap V1.0 has been launched on the 5^th^ of December 2017 during World Soil Day. At the launching, the map is based on more than 1 million sampling points. The product is hosted by GLOSIS and constantly updated. It is available as an online application, accessible at the link: http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/pillars-action/4-information-and-data/global-soil-organic-carbon-gsoc-map/en/.

The following deliverables are comprised with GSOCmap V1.0:

*   GSOCmap V1.0 is digitally delivered in grid (GeoTIFF) format with a 30 arc-second resolution. The global data can be downloaded as `GSOCmap.tif`.
*    The associated uncertainty layers and prediction quality figures, including qualitative assessment from conventional upscaling, and quantitative assessment for DSM methods. The prediction uncertainty is provided with the estimated map quality measures such as mean error, mean absolute error, (root) mean squared error etc.
*   The metadata providing standardized information about a data set, for example, the maintaining institution through which the data can be accessed. In the case of the GSOCmap, a project-specific metadata template has been prepared. It deviates from the metadata elements listed in common standards such as ISO 19115. Following the [*GSP Guidelines for Sharing National Data/Information to Compile a Global Soil Organic Carbon (GSOC) Map*](http://www.fao.org/3/a-bp164e.pdf) [@gsp_guidelines_2017], providing technical guidelines to prepare and evaluate spatial soil data sets to, where the importance of soil-specific methodical elements is given. This includes metadata describing the data sources used for SOC mapping and the upscaling method.
* A GSOCmap information leaflet available in three different languages providing an overview of the development process, 

The GSOCmap provides users and relevant stakeholders such as policy makers with useful information to monitor soil condition, identify degraded land and soil areas, set restoration targets, explore SOC sequestration potentials, support the greenhouse gas emission reporting under the UNFCCC and make evidence based decisions to mitigate and adapt to a changing climate on a national as well as on a global level.
