# Foreword

Under the leadership of the International Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS), members of the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) conducted a soil carbon mapping programme, where existing data in national soil information systems were used to develop 1 km grids of soil carbon stocks, following a guideline with background and detailed specifications. These grids fulfill the criteria developed for the version 0 grids of Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) under Pillar 4 of the GSP.

This cookbook provides step-by-step guidance for developing 1 km grids for soil carbon stocks. It includes the preparation of local soil data, the compilation and pre-processing of ancillary spatial data sets, upscaling methodologies, and uncertainty assessments. Guidance is mainly specific to soil carbon data, but also contains many generic sections on soil grid development, as it is relevant for other soil properties.

Therefore, this first edition is the beginning of a series of updates and extensions, necessary to cover a larger variety of upscaling approaches. Experiences gained throughout 2017 during the GSOC map programme, through applications at country scale and various trainings scheduled for 2017, shall be considered in the next editions. Also, the section on uncertainties will be adjusted to more practical implementation steps.
