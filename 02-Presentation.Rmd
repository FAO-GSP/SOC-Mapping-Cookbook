# Presentation

The Global Soil Partnership (GSP) aims to promote sustainable soil management at all levels and in all land uses through normative tools that rely on evidencebased science. Understanding the status of a given soil, including its properties and functions, and relating this information to the ecosystem services that soil provides becomes a mandatory action before making decisions on how to manage a soil sustainably. To achieve this, the availability of and use of soil data and information is fundamental to underpin soil management decisions. For this reason, members of the GSP have decided to establish a Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) that relies on national soil information systems.

In the process of establishing GLOSIS, a number of tools and networks are being created, including the International Network of Soil Information Institutions (INSII), a soil data policy and more. Taking advantage of this process and responding to a request for support in developing the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators, especially Indicator 15.3, the GSP Plenary Assembly instructed the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils and the GSP Secretariat to develop a Global Soil Organic Carbon Map (GSOCMap) following the same bottom-up approach as GLOSIS. To this end, members under the INSII umbrella developed guidelines and technical specifications for the preparation of the [GSOCMap](http://www.fao.org/3/a-bp164e.pdf) and countries were invited to prepare their national soil organic carbon maps according to these specifications.

Given the scientific advances in tools for mapping soil organic carbon (SOC), many countries requested the GSP Secretariat to support them in the process of preparing these national maps. An intensive capacity development programme on SOC carbon mapping was the answer to support countries in this process. Various regional and national training sessions were organized using an on-the-job-training modality to ensure that national experts were trained using their own datasets. To support this capacity development process, a reference knowledge source was needed, hence the GSP Secretariat invited a group of top experts to prepare a Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Cookbook.

This cookbook provides generic methodologies and the technical steps to produce a SOC map. This includes step-by-step guidance for developing 1 km grids for SOC stocks, as well as for the preparation of local soil data, the compilation and preprocessing of ancillary spatial data sets, upscaling methodologies, and uncertainty assessments. Guidance is mainly specific to soil carbon data, but also contains many generic sections on soil grid development due to its relevance for other soil properties. 

The main focus of the guidance is on the upscaling of SOC stocks in the GSOCMap and as such the cookbook supplements the “GSP Guidelines for sharing national data/information to compile a Global Soil Organic Carbon (GSOC) map”. It provides technical guidelines to prepare and evaluate spatial soil data sets to: 
* Determine SOC stocks from local samples to a target depth of 30 cm;
* Prepare spatial covariates for upscaling; and
* Select and apply the best suitable upscaling methodology.

In terms of statistical upscaling methods, the use of conventional upscaling methods using soil maps and soil profiles is still very common, although this approach is mostly considered empirical by soil mappers. Even though evaluations are based on polygon soil maps, the resulting SOC maps can be rasterized to any target grid. However, a spatially-explicit assessment of uncertainties is impossible. The use of digital soil mapping to upscale local soil information is increasingly applied and recommended.

This cookbook presents two approaches in detail, namely spatial modelling using either regression or data mining analysis, combined with geostatistics as regression kriging.

This first edition of the cookbook will be followed by a series of updates and extensions that would be necessary to cover a larger variety of upscaling approaches. The experiences gained throughout 2017 during the implementation of the GSOCMap capacity development programme will be considered in the next editions. This will especially include updates in the section on uncertainties which will be adjusted to provide more practical implementation steps.

It is our hope that this cookbook will fulfil its mandate of easily enabling any user to produce a SOC or other soil property map using soil legacy data and modern methods of digital soil mapping in contribution to improved decision making on soil management.
